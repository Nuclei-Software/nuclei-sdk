# N100 Software Development Kit

This N100 SDK is modified based on the **Nuclei SDK** framework, NMSIS is also a modified version to support limited feature provided by Nuclei N100 processor.

> Currently only baremetal cases are supported.

We also intergated three RTOSes into Nuclei SDK, which are **FreeRTOS**, **UCOSII** and **RTThread**, you can easily find it in the *OS* folder.

> Currently RTOS not yet supported, please don't use it.

## Quick Startup

## Requirements

* Ubuntu Linux >=20.04 LTS or Windows >=7
  - **Linux**: GNU Make >= 3.82
  - **Windows**: [Windows Build Tools](https://nucleisys.com/download.php)
* [Nuclei Studio >= 2024.02](https://nucleisys.com/download.php)
  - Nuclei Studio can support import Nuclei SDK NPK package to provide IDE project wizard create/build/debug.
  - Nuclei Studio also contains same release of Nuclei Toolchain/QEMU/OpenOCD, so just download IDE is enough.

## How to use

1. Create and modify your own setup config, see comments in `setup.bat` or `setup.sh`
   * For **Linux**, create `setup_config.sh` in **$NUCLEI_SDK_ROOT**.
   * For **Windows**, create `setup_config.bat` in **%NUCLEI_SDK_ROOT%**.
2. Source the environment script right in **NUCLEI_SDK_ROOT**
   * For **Linux**: `source setup.sh`
   * For **Windows**: `setup.bat`
3. Build and run application.
   * **Note:** By default, the SoC and Board is set to ``evalsoc`` and ``nuclei_fpga_eval``,
     if you don't pass any **SOC** and **BOARD** variable in Make command,
     it will use the default SoC and Board.
   * Assume that you will run this application -> *application/baremetal/helloworld/*.
   * cd *application/baremetal/helloworld/*
   * you can run *make help* to show help message.
   * We provided different Nuclei Core configurations(CORE=<your_core>) we supported, see *Build/Makefile.core*.
     - such as `CORE=n100m`
   * We support several download modes(DOWNLOAD=<mode>) for different applications.
     - **ilm**: Program will be download into ilm/ram and run directly in ilm/ram, program lost when poweroff
     - **flashxip**: Program will to be download into flash and run directly in Flash
   * For example, if you want to build your application for *CORE=n100m DOWNLOAD=ilm*, you can easily run this command:
     ~~~shell
     make CORE=n100m DOWNLOAD=ilm all
     ~~~
   * If you want to upload your application for *CORE=n100m DOWNLOAD=ilm*, you can easily run this command:
     ~~~shell
     make CORE=n100m DOWNLOAD=ilm upload
     ~~~
   * (Option 1)If you want to debug your application for *CORE=n100m DOWNLOAD=ilm*:
     - First open a new terminal in the same application folder and run: `make CORE=n100m DOWNLOAD=ilm run_openocd`
     - Then run this command `make CORE=n100m DOWNLOAD=ilm run_gdb` in the existing terminal, then you can debug it using gdb,
       if you want to load your program, you need to type `load` to achieve it.
     - **Notice**: Since version 0.2.4, you can also pass extra `GDB_PORT=<portno>`, to change to use new gdb port other than default
       `3333`, for example, `make CORE=n100m DOWNLOAD=ilm GDB_PORT=3344 run_openocd` and `make CORE=n100m DOWNLOAD=ilm GDB_PORT=3344 run_gdb`
   * (Option 2)If you want to debug your application for *CORE=n100m DOWNLOAD=ilm*:
     ~~~shell
     make CORE=n100m DOWNLOAD=ilm debug
     ~~~
   * If you want to use UART terminal tool to view the UART message, you can choose `screen` or `minicom` in Linux, `teraterm` in Windows, the default UART baudrate we use is `115200`.

## Knowledge book

* N100 SDK only support Nuclei RISC-V Toolchain > 2023.10, need to get it via AE now, not official released, and toolchain prefix is `riscv64-unknown-elf-`.

* N100 SDK is modified based on Nuclei SDK, so the user experience are similiar to Nuclei SDK, and directory structure is also similar, if you have experience in using Nuclei SDK, it will be easy to use N100 SDK.
