Overview
--------

In Nuclei SDK, we just provided applications which can
run in different boards without any changes in code to
demostrate the baremetal service, freertos service and
ucosii service features.

The provided applications can be divided into three categories:

* Bare-metal applications: Located in ``application/baremetal``

* FreeRTOS applications: Located in ``application/freertos``

* UCOSII applications: Located in ``application/ucosii``

* RTThread applications: Located in ``application/rtthread``

If you want to develop your own application in Nuclei SDK, please click
:ref:`develop_appdev` to learn more about it.

The following applications are running using RV-STAR board.

demo_eclic
~~~~~~~~~~

This `demo_eclic application`_ is used to demostrate how to use
the ECLIC API and Interrupt.

.. note::

    In this application's Makefile, we provided comments in Makefile about optimize
    for code size.

    If you want to optimize this application for code size, you can set the ``COMMON_FLAGS``
    variable to the following values, we recommend to use ``-Os -flto``.

* The timer interrupt and timer software interrupt are used
* The timer interrupt is registered as non-vector interrupt
* The timer software interrupt is registered as vector interrupt,
  and we enable its preemptive feature by using ``SAVE_IRQ_CSR_CONTEXT``
  and ``RESTORE_IRQ_CSR_CONTEXT`` in timer software interrupt handler
* The timer interrupt is triggered periodly
* The timer software interrupt is triggered in timer interrupt handler using
  ``SysTimer_SetSWIRQ`` function.
* In the application code, there is a macro called ``SWIRQ_INTLEVEL_HIGHER`` to
  control the timer software interrupt working feature:

  - If **SWIRQ_INTLEVEL_HIGHER=1**, the timer software interrupt level is higher then
    timer interrupt level, so when timer software interrupt is triggerred, then timer
    software interrupt will be processed immediately, and timer interrupt will be preempted
    by timer software interrupt.

  - If **SWIRQ_INTLEVEL_HIGHER=0**, the timer software interrupt level is lower then
    timer interrupt level, so when timer software interrupt is triggerred, then timer
    software interrupt will be processed after timer interrupt, and timer interrupt will
    not be preempted by timer software interrupt.

**How to run this application:**

.. code-block:: shell

    # Assume that you can set up the Tools and Nuclei SDK environment
    # cd to the demo_eclic directory
    cd application/baremetal/demo_eclic
    # Change macro SWIRQ_INTLEVEL_HIGHER value in demo_eclic.c
    # to see different working mode of this demo
    # Clean the application first
    make SOC=gd32vf103 BOARD=gd32vf103v_rvstar clean
    # Build and upload the application
    make SOC=gd32vf103 BOARD=gd32vf103v_rvstar upload

**Expected output(SWIRQ_INTLEVEL_HIGHER=1) as below:**

demo_dsp
~~~~~~~~

This `demo_dsp application`_ is used to demostrate how to NMSIS-DSP API.

* Mainly show how we can use DSP library and header files.
* It mainly demo the ``riscv_conv_xx`` functions and its reference functions
* If your Nuclei Processor Core has DSP feature enabled, you can pass extra
  ``DSP_ENABLE=ON`` in your make command to use NMSIS-DSP library with DSP enabled.
* By default, the application will use NMSIS-DSP library with DSP enabled.

.. note::

    * From version 0.2.4, this demo is upgraded to a more complex version which
      shows the usage of ``riscv_conv_xx`` functions, and ``DSP_ENABLE`` is changed
      from ``OFF`` to ``ON`` by default.
    * The GD32VF103 SoC didn't has DSP enabled, so this SoC can only use NMSIS-DSP
      library with DSP disabled, so please pass extra ``DSP_ENABLE=OFF`` when run make.
    * For other Nuclei Processor Core based SoC, please check whether it has DSP
      feature enabled to decide which kind of **NMSIS-DSP** library to use.
    * Even our NMSIS-DSP library with DSP disabled are also optimized, so it can
      also provide good performance in some functions.

**How to run this application:**

.. code-block:: shell

    # Assume that you can set up the Tools and Nuclei SDK environment
    # cd to the demo_dsp directory
    cd application/baremetal/demo_dsp

coremark
~~~~~~~~

This `coremark benchmark application`_ is used to run EEMBC CoreMark Software.

EEMBC CoreMark Software is a product of EEMBC and is provided under the terms of the
CoreMark License that is distributed with the official EEMBC COREMARK Software release.
If you received this EEMBC CoreMark Software without the accompanying CoreMark License,
you must discontinue use and download the official release from www.coremark.org.

In Nuclei SDK, we provided code and Makefile for this ``coremark`` application.
You can also optimize the ``COMMON_FLAGS`` defined in coremark application Makefile
to get different score number.

* By default, this application runs for 500 iterations, you can also change this in Makefile.
  e.g. Change this ``-DITERATIONS=500`` to value such as ``-DITERATIONS=5000``
* macro **PERFORMANCE_RUN=1** is defined
* **PFLOAT = 1** is added in its Makefile to enable float value print

.. note::

   * Since for each SoC platforms, the CPU frequency is different, so user need to change
     the ``ITERATIONS`` defined in Makefile to proper value to let the coremark run at least
     10 seconds
   * For example, for the ``gd32vf103`` based boards supported in Nuclei SDK, we suggest
     to change ``-DITERATIONS=500`` to ``-DITERATIONS=5000``

**How to run this application:**

.. code-block:: shell

    # Assume that you can set up the Tools and Nuclei SDK environment
    # cd to the coremark directory
    cd application/baremetal/benchmark/coremark
    # change ITERATIONS value in Makefile for gd32vf103 based board to 5000

dhrystone
~~~~~~~~~

This `dhrystone benchmark application`_ is used to run DHRYSTONE Benchmark Software.

The Dhrystone benchmark program has become a popular benchmark for CPU/compiler performance measurement,
in particular in the area of minicomputers, workstations, PC's and microprocesors.

* It apparently satisfies a need for an easy-to-use integer benchmark;
* it gives a first performance indication which is more meaningful than MIPS numbers which,
  in their literal meaning (million instructions per second), cannot be used across different
  instruction sets (e.g. RISC vs. CISC).
* With the increasing use of the benchmark, it seems necessary to reconsider the benchmark and
  to check whether it can still fulfill this function.

In Nuclei SDK, we provided code and Makefile for this ``dhrystone`` application.
You can also optimize the ``COMMON_FLAGS`` defined in dhrystone application Makefile
to get different score number.

* **PFLOAT = 1** is added in its Makefile to enable float value print
* You can change ``Number_Of_Runs`` in ``dhry_1.c`` line 134 to increate or decrease
  number of iterations

**How to run this application:**

.. code-block:: shell

    # Assume that you can set up the Tools and Nuclei SDK environment
    # cd to the dhrystone directory
    cd application/baremetal/benchmark/dhrystone

whetstone
~~~~~~~~~

This `whetstone benchmark application`_ is used to run C/C++ Whetstone Benchmark Software
(Single or Double Precision).

The Fortran Whetstone programs were the first general purpose benchmarks that set industry
standards of computer system performance. Whetstone programs also addressed the question
of the efficiency of different programming languages, an important issue not covered by
more contemporary standard benchmarks.

In Nuclei SDK, we provided code and Makefile for this ``whetstone`` application.
You can also optimize the ``COMMON_FLAGS`` defined in whetstone application Makefile
to get different score number.

* **PFLOAT = 1** is added in its Makefile to enable float value print
* Extra **LDFLAGS := -lm** is added in its Makefile to include the math library


**How to run this application:**

.. code-block:: shell

    # Assume that you can set up the Tools and Nuclei SDK environment
    # cd to the whetstone directory
    cd application/baremetal/benchmark/whetstone
    # Clean the application first
    make SOC=gd32vf103 BOARD=gd32vf103v_rvstar clean
    # Build and upload the application
    make SOC=gd32vf103 BOARD=gd32vf103v_rvstar upload

**Expected output as below:**
