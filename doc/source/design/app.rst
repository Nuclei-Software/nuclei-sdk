Application
===========

.. _design_app_overview:

Overview
--------

In Nuclei N100 SDK, we just provided applications which can
run in different boards without any changes in code to
demonstrate the baremetal service, freertos service and
ucosii service features.

The provided applications can be divided into three categories:

* Bare-metal applications: Located in ``application/baremetal``

* FreeRTOS applications: Located in ``application/freertos``

* UCOSII applications: Located in ``application/ucosii``

* RTThread applications: Located in ``application/rtthread``

If you want to develop your own application in Nuclei N100 SDK, please click
:ref:`develop_appdev` to learn more about it.

The following applications are running Nuclei Eval SoC.

.. note::

    * Only benchmark/helloworld can run on Nuclei Qemu >= 2024.02 now.
    * Most of the application demostrated below using ``SOC=evalsoc``,
      you can easily change it to other SoC such as evalsoc by change it to
      ``SOC=evalsoc``
    * Some applications may not be able to be run on your SoC using Nuclei CPU
      due to lack of cpu feature required to run on it.
    * Almost all the applications required Nuclei CPU configured with
      irqc and System Timer hardware feature.
    * Almost all the application required UART to print message, so you need to
      implement an UART drivers and clib stub functions, if you use
      :ref:`develop_buildsystem_var_semihost` to print message, it is not required.

Bare-metal applications

.. _design_app_coremark:

coremark
~~~~~~~~

This `coremark benchmark application`_ is used to run EEMBC CoreMark Software.

EEMBC CoreMark Software is a product of EEMBC and is provided under the terms of the
CoreMark License that is distributed with the official EEMBC COREMARK Software release.
If you received this EEMBC CoreMark Software without the accompanying CoreMark License,
you must discontinue use and download the official release from www.coremark.org.

In Nuclei N100 SDK, we provided code and Makefile for this ``coremark`` application.
You can also optimize the ``COMMON_FLAGS`` defined in coremark application Makefile
to get different score number.

* By default, this application runs for 15 iterations, you can also change this in Makefile.
  e.g. Change this ``-DITERATIONS=15`` to value such as ``-DITERATIONS=20``
* macro **PERFORMANCE_RUN=1** is defined
* **STDCLIB ?= newlib_small** is added in its Makefile to enable float value print

.. note::

    N100's time and cycle counter is only 24bit, easy to overflow, so make sure
    the iteration is small.

**How to run this application:**

.. code-block:: shell

.. _design_app_dhrystone:

dhrystone
~~~~~~~~~

This `dhrystone benchmark application`_ is used to run DHRYSTONE Benchmark Software.

The Dhrystone benchmark program has become a popular benchmark for CPU/compiler performance measurement,
in particular in the area of minicomputers, workstations, PC's and microprocesors.

* It apparently satisfies a need for an easy-to-use integer benchmark;
* it gives a first performance indication which is more meaningful than MIPS numbers which,
  in their literal meaning (million instructions per second), cannot be used across different
  instruction sets (e.g. RISC vs. CISC).
* With the increasing use of the benchmark, it seems necessary to reconsider the benchmark and
  to check whether it can still fulfill this function.

In Nuclei N100 SDK, we provided code and Makefile for this ``dhrystone`` application.
You can also optimize the ``COMMON_FLAGS`` defined in dhrystone application Makefile
to get different score number.

* **STDCLIB ?= newlib_small** is added in its Makefile to enable float value print

**How to run this application:**

.. code-block:: shell

    # Assume that you can set up the Tools and Nuclei N100 SDK environment
    # cd to the dhrystone directory

.. _design_app_whetstone:

whetstone
~~~~~~~~~

This `whetstone benchmark application`_ is used to run C/C++ Whetstone Benchmark Software
(Single or Double Precision).

The Fortran Whetstone programs were the first general purpose benchmarks that set industry
standards of computer system performance. Whetstone programs also addressed the question
of the efficiency of different programming languages, an important issue not covered by
more contemporary standard benchmarks.

In Nuclei N100 SDK, we provided code and Makefile for this ``whetstone`` application.
You can also optimize the ``COMMON_FLAGS`` defined in whetstone application Makefile
to get different score number.

* **STDCLIB ?= newlib_small** is added in its Makefile to enable float value print
* Extra **LDLIBS := -lm** is added in its Makefile to include the math library

**How to run this application:**

.. code-block:: shell

    # Assume that you can set up the Tools and Nuclei N100 SDK environment
    # cd to the whetstone directory
    cd application/baremetal/benchmark/whetstone

In Nuclei N100 SDK, we provided code and Makefile for this ``rtthread demo`` application.

* **RTOS = RTThread** is added in its Makefile to include RT-Thread service
* The **RT_TICK_PER_SECOND** in ``rtconfig.h`` is by default set to `100`, you can change it
  to other number according to your requirement.


**How to run this application:**

.. code-block:: shell

    # Assume that you can set up the Tools and Nuclei N100 SDK environment
    # cd to the rtthread demo directory
    cd application/rtthread/demo
    # Clean the application first
    make SOC=evalsoc clean
    # Build and upload the application
    make SOC=evalsoc upload

**Expected output as below:**

.. code-block:: console

msh
~~~

This `rt-thread msh application`_ demonstrates msh shell in serial console which is a component of rt-thread.

* ``MSH_CMD_EXPORT(nsdk, msh nuclei sdk demo)`` exports a command ``nsdk`` to msh shell

In Nuclei N100 SDK, we provided code and Makefile for this ``rtthread msh`` application.

* **RTOS = RTThread** is added in its Makefile to include RT-Thread service
* **RTTHREAD_MSH := 1** is added in its Makefile to include RT-Thread msh component
* The **RT_TICK_PER_SECOND** in ``rtconfig.h`` is by default set to `100`, you can change it
  to other number according to your requirement.

**How to run this application:**

.. code-block:: shell

    # Assume that you can set up the Tools and Nuclei N100 SDK environment
    # cd to the rtthread msh directory
    cd application/rtthread/msh
    # Clean the application first
    make SOC=evalsoc clean
    # Build and upload the application
    make SOC=evalsoc upload
