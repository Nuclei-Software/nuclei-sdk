.. _design_soc_gd32vf103_overview:

Overview
--------

The GD32VF103 device is a 32-bit general-purpose micro controller based on
the RISC-V core with best ratio in terms of processing power, reduced power
consumption and peripheral set.

The RISC-V processor core is tightly coupled with an Enhancement Core-Local
Interrupt Controller(ECLIC), SysTick timer and advanced debug support.

The GD32VF103 device incorporates the RISC-V 32-bit processor core operating at
108MHz frequency with Flash accesses zero wait states to obtain maximum efficiency.

It provides up to 128KB on-chip Flash memory and 32KB SRAM memory.

An extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connect to two APB buses.

The devices offer up to two 12-bit ADCs, up to two 12-bit DACs, up to four general
16-bit timers, two basic timers plus a PWM advanced timer, as well as standard and
advanced communication interfaces: up to three SPIs, two I2Cs, three USARTs, two UARTs,
two I2Ss, two CANs, an USBFS.

.. _design_soc_gd32vf103_usage:

Usage
-----

If you want to use this **GD32VF103** SoC in Nuclei SDK, you need to set the
:ref:`develop_buildsystem_var_soc` Makefile variable to ``gd32vf103``.

.. code-block:: shell

    # Choose SoC to be gd32vf103
    # the following command will build application
    # using default gd32vf103 SoC based board
    # defined in Build System and application Makefile
    make SOC=gd32vf103 all
