Nuclei Demo SoC
===============

.. note::

    Since Hummingbird is already taken by the opensource
    Hummingbird E203 SoC, we just rename Hummingbird SoC in Nuclei SDK
    to Nuclei Demo SoC to make it more clear.
    For newer version of Nuclei CPU IP from 2022.07, which might has iregion
    feature, please use Eval SoC instead of Demo SoC.


Nuclei Demo SoC support in Nuclei SDK is removed in 0.5.0 release, please use
:ref:`design_soc_evalsoc` now.
