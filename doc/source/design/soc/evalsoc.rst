Nuclei Eval SoC
===============

.. note::

    Nuclei CPU IP now with iregion feature will use totally new evaluation SoC,
    this SoC is different from previous Demo SoC, please take care.

    Nuclei DemoSoC is now removed in 0.5.0 release, and please use evalsoc now.

Nuclei Eval SoC is an evaluation FPGA SoC from Nuclei
for customer to evaluate Nuclei RISC-V Process Core, and it is a successor for Demo SoC.

.. _design_soc_evalsoc_overview:

Overview
--------

To easy user to evaluate Nuclei Processor Core, the prototype
SoC (called Nuclei Eval SoC) is provided for evaluation purpose.

This prototype SoC includes:

* Processor Core, it can be Nuclei N class, NX class or UX class Processor Core.
* On-Chip SRAMs for instruction and data.
* The SoC buses.
* The basic peripherals, such as UART, SPI etc.

With this prototype SoC, user can run simulations, map it into the FPGA board,
and run with real embedded application examples.

If you want to learn more about this evaluation SoC, please get the
``<Nuclei_Eval_SoC_Intro.pdf>`` from `Nuclei`_.


.. _design_soc_evalsoc_boards:

Supported Boards
----------------

In Nuclei SDK, we support the following boards based on **Nuclei Evaluation SoC**, see:

* :ref:`design_board_nuclei_fpga_eval`, default Board when this SoC selected.

.. _design_soc_evalsoc_usage:

Usage
-----

.. note::

    In latest CPU RTL generation flow, it will also generate an Nuclei SDK to match CPU
    and EvalSoC RTL configuration, please use the generated Nuclei SDK to evaluate your
    CPU and EvalSoC feature.

    The generated Nuclei SDK by **nuclei_gen** will do the following tasks:

    - Generate ``SoC/evalsoc/cpufeature.mk``: which will define **CORE**, **ARCH_EXT**, **QEMU_SOCCFG** or **SIMULATION** default value.
    - Generate ``SoC/evalsoc/Common/Include/cpufeature.h``: which will define current cpu feature macros.
    - Generate ``SoC/evalsoc/evalsoc.json``: which will define current qemu soc configuration according to the evalsoc and cpu configuration.
    - Generate ``SoC/evalsoc/Board/nuclei_fpga_eval/Source/GCC/evalsoc.memory``: which will define the ilm/dlm/flash/ddr/sram base address and size.
    - Modify ``SoC/evalsoc/Board/nuclei_fpga_eval/openocd_evalsoc.cfg``: Mainly change ``workmem_base/workmem_size/flashxip_base/xipnuspi_base`` to adapt the evalsoc configuration.

    If you want to use the generated Nuclei SDK by **nuclei_gen** In Nuclei Studio IDE, you need to zip it first,
    and then **import** it using ``RV-Tools -> NPK Package Management`` in Nuclei Studio IDE's menu, and when
    creating a IDE project using ``New Nuclei RISC-V C/C++ Project``, please select the correct sdk and version which
    you can check it in the ``<SDK>/npk.yml`` file, and in the project example configuration wizard window, you should
    configure the **Nuclei RISC-V Core** and **ARCH Extensions**, **Nuclei Cache Extensions**
    according to your configured CPU ISA, and CPU feature defined in generated ``cpufeature.h``.

    **WARNING**: Currently you still need to modify IAR linker script(``*.icf``) by yourself, it is not automatically modified.

If you want to use this **Nuclei Evaluation SoC** in Nuclei SDK, you need to set the
:ref:`develop_buildsystem_var_soc` Makefile variable to ``evalsoc``.

Extra make variables supported only in this SoC and used internally only by Nuclei, not designed for widely used:
  * **RUNMODE**: it is used internally by Nuclei, used to control ILM/DLM/ICache/DCache enable or disable
    via make variable, please check ``SoC/evalsoc/runmode.mk`` for details. It is not functional by default,
    unless you set a non-empty variable to this ``RUNMODE`` variable, it can be used with different **ILM_EN/DLM_EN/IC_EN/DC_EN/CCM_EN**.
  * **L2_EN**: it is used internally by Nuclei, used to control L2 cache enable or disable, introduced in 0.6.0 release.
  * **LDSPEC_EN**: it is used internally by Nuclei, used to control load speculative enable or disable, introduced in 0.6.0 release.
  * **BPU_EN**: it is used internally by Nuclei, used to control branch prediction unit enable or disable, introduced in 0.6.0 release.

.. code-block:: shell

    # Choose SoC to be evalsoc
    # the following command will build application
    # using default evalsoc SoC based board
    # defined in Build System and application Makefile
    make SOC=evalsoc info # you can check current working SDK configuration information
    make SOC=evalsoc clean
