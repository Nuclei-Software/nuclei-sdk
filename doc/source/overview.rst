Introduction
------------

.. note::

    Since 0.5.0 release of Nuclei SDK, we need to use Nuclei Studio >= 2023.10 or Nuclei Toolchain
    >=2023.10 to build and run it, see release changelog.

The **Nuclei Software Development Kit (SDK)** is an open-source software platform to
speed up the software development of SoCs based on Nuclei Processor Cores.

This Nuclei SDK is built based on the |NMSIS|, user can access all the APIs provided
by |NMSIS| and also the APIs that provided by Nuclei SDK which mainly for on-board
peripherals access such as GPIO, UART, SPI and I2C, etc.

Nuclei SDK provides a good start base for embedded developers which will help them simplify
software development and improve time-to-market through well-designed software framework.

Design and Architecture
-----------------------

The Nuclei SDK general design and architecture are shown in the block diagram as below.

   Nuclei SDK Design and Architecture Diagram

As :ref:`figure_overview_1` shown, The Nuclei SDK provides the following features:

* Nuclei Core API service is built on top of |NMSIS|, so silicon vendors of Nuclei processors can easily
  port their SoCs to Nuclei SDK, and quickly evaluate software on their SoC.
* **NMSIS-NN** and **NMSIS-DSP** library can be also used in Nuclei SDK, and the prebuilt libraries are
  included in **NMSIS/Library** folder of Nuclei SDK.
* Mainly support two Nuclei Processor based SoCs, :ref:`design_soc_evalsoc` and :ref:`design_soc_gd32vf103`
* Provided realtime operation system service via :ref:`design_rtos_freertos`, :ref:`design_rtos_ucosii` and
  :ref:`design_rtos_rtthread`
* Provided bare-metal service for embedded system software beginners and resource-limited use-cases.
* Currently Nuclei SDK doesn't define any common device APIs to access GPIO/I2C/SPI/UART devices, which still
  relies on the device/peripheral APIs from firmware libraries provided by various silicon vendors, such as current
  supported :ref:`design_soc_gd32vf103`.
* Applications are logically separated into three parts:

  - **General applications for all Nuclei Processors**: In the Nuclei SDK software code, the applications provided
    are all general applications which can run on all Nuclei Processors, with basic UART service to provide ``printf`` function.
  - **Nuclei Demo SoC applications**: These applications are not included in the Nuclei SDK software code, and it is
    *maintained separately*, which will use resource from Nuclei Demo SoC and its evaluation boards to develop applications, which will
    not be compatible with different boards.
  - **GD32VF103 SoC applications**: These applications are not included in the Nuclei SDK software code, and it is
    *maintained separately*, which will use resource from GD32VF103 SoC and its evaluation boards to develop applications, which will
    not be compatible with different boards.
