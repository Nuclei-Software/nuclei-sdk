.. note::

   - This 0.5.0 version is a big change version for Nuclei SDK, it now support `Nuclei Toolchain 2023.10`_,
     which have gnu toolchain and llvm toolchain in it, gcc version increased to gcc 13, and clang version
     used is clang 17. It will no longer support old gcc 10 version, since gcc and clang ``-march`` option
     changed a lot, such as b extension changed to ``_zba_zbb_zbc_zbs``.
   - This version also introduced other compiler support such as terapines zcc and IAR compiler.
     For terapines zcc compiler, please visit https://www.terapines.com/ to contact them for toolchain evaluation, pass ``TOOLCHAIN=terapines`` during make to select terapines zcc compiler.
     For IAR compiler, please visit https://www.iar.com/riscv for IAR workbench evaluation, we provided iar projects to take a try with it.
   - This version introduced libncrt v3.0.0 support, which split libncrt library into three parts, you need to take care when using newer toolchain.
   - This version removed demosoc support, please use evalsoc instead.
   - This version introduced qemu 8.0 support, old qemu will not be supported.
   - This version introduced Nuclei Studio 2023.10 support which introduced llvm toolchain support via npk, so it can only works with 2023.10 or later version.
   - This version required a lot of new npk features introduced in `Nuclei Studio 2023.10`_, so it can only be imported as npk package in `Nuclei Studio 2023.10`_ or later version.

* Application

  - Add cpuinfo case to dump nuclei cpu feature
  - Add stack check demo to demostrate nuclei stack check feature
  - Add support for gcc13/clang17/terapines/iar compiler

  - Do specical adaption for demo_pmp/demo_spmp for iar compiler which require customized iar linker icf for this cases
  - Optimize benchmark flags when using gcc 13

* NMSIS

  - Add bench reset/sample/stop/stat and get usecyc/sumcyc/lpcnt APIs in NMSIS Core
  - Add more CSRs such as Zc/Stack Check in riscv_encoding.h
  - Rename NMSIS DSP/NN library name to match gcc 13 changes, eg. ``b -> zba_zbb_zbc_zbs``, so the library name changed a lot
  - Add IAR compiler support in NMSIS Core
  - No more bitmanip extension intrinsic header ``<rvintrin.h>`` for gcc13
  - Fix ``__RV_CLAMP`` macro and add ``__MACHINE/SUPERVISOR/USER_INTERRUPT`` macros
  - Add ``__get_hart_index`` and ``SysTimer_GetHartID`` and modify ``__get_hart_id`` API
  - In <Device.h>, we introduced ``__HARTID_OFFSET`` and ``__SYSTIMER_HARTID`` macro to represent timer hart index relation with cpu hartid for AMP SoC
  - Update NMSIS Core/DSP/NN header files to `NMSIS 1.2.0`_
  - Update NMSIS DSP/NN prebuilt library to v1.2.0, and added F16 prebuilt library

* SOC

  - **CAUTION**: Demosoc support is removed since evalsoc is the successor, please use **evalsoc** now.
  - Set **RUNMODE_CCM_EN** macro when **CCM_EN** make variable passed and allow ``__CCM_PRESENT`` overwrite by **RUNMODE_CCM_EN** macro
  - Enable ``__CIDU_PRESENT`` macro passed via compiler option
  - Update cpu startup asm code to fix clang compile issue such as STB_WEAK warning and non-ABS relocation error
  - Update cpu startup asm code to support zcmt jump table
  - Update gnu linker files to support zcmt extension
  - Update gnu linker files to fix 2 byte gap issue, and align section to 8bytes and reorg sections

  - Add new macros ``__HARTID_OFFSET`` and ``__SYSTIMER_HARTID`` in evalsoc.h
  - Add **HARTID_OFFSET** make variable to control hartid offset for evalsoc
  - Boot hartid check no longer only compare lower 8bits for evalsoc
  - Currently IAR compiler support is only for single core support, smp support is not yet ready and need to use in IAR workbench
  - Update Nuclei Studio NPK files to support both gcc and llvm toolchain support, this require `Nuclei Studio 2023.10`_, which is incompatiable with previous IDE version.

* Build System

  - Fix semihost not working when link with semihost library
  - Add support for gcc 13, clang 17, terapines zcc toolchain using :ref:`develop_buildsystem_var_toolchain` make variable, eg. ``TOOLCHAIN=nuclei_gnu`` for gnu gcc toolchain, ``TOOLCHAIN=nuclei_llvm`` for llvm toolchain, ``TOOLCHAIN=terapines`` for terapines zcc toolchain
  - Add support for libncrt v3.0.0, which spilt libncrt into 3 parts, the c library part, fileops part, and heapops part, so :ref:`develop_buildsystem_var_ncrtheap` and :ref:`develop_buildsystem_var_ncrtio` makefile variable are added to support new version of libncrt, about upgrading libncrt, please check :ref:`develop_buildsystem_var_stdclib`
  - To support both gcc, clang, zcc, now we no longer use ``--specs=nano.specs`` like ``--specs=`` gcc only options, since clang don't support it, we directly link the required libraries according to the library type you want to use in Makefile, group all the required libraries using ``--start-group archives --end-group`` of linker option, see https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/Options.html, but when using Nuclei Studio, the Eclipse CDT based IDE didn't provided a good way to do library group, here is an issue tracking it, see https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/issues/592

    - And also now we defaultly enabled ``-nodefaultlibs`` option to not use any standard system libraries when linking, so we need to specify the system libraries we want to use during linking, which is the best way to support both gcc and clang toolchain.

  - When using libncrt library, this is no need to link with other libgcc library, c library or math library, such as gcc libgcc library(``-lgcc``), newlib c library(``-lc/-lc_nano``) and math library(``-lm``), the c and math features are also provided in libncrt library
  - When using Nuclei Studio with imported Nuclei SDK NPK package, you might meet with undefined reference issue during link
  - The use of :ref:`develop_buildsystem_var_archext` is changed for new toolchain, eg. you can't pass ``ARCH_EXT=bp`` to represent b/p extension, instead you need to pass ``ARCH_EXT=_zba_zbb_zbc_zbs_xxldspn1x``
  - Show CC/CXX/GDB when make showflags
  - Add u900 series cores support
  - No longer support gd32vf103 soc run on qemu
  - Add extra ``-fomit-frame-pointer -fno-shrink-wrap-separate`` options for Zc extension to enable zcmp instruction generation
  - Extra **CPU_SERIES** macro is passed such (200/300/600/900) during compiling for benchmark examples
  - When you want to select different nmsis library arch, please use :ref:`develop_buildsystem_var_nmsis_lib_arch` make variable, see demo_dsp as example

* Tools

  - A lot of changes mainly in nsdk cli configs have been made to remove support of demosoc, and change it to evalsoc
  - A lot of changes mainly in nsdk cli configs have been made to support newer :ref:`develop_buildsystem_var_archext` variable format

  - Add demo_cache to demo ccm feature of Nuclei RISC-V Processor
  - Optimize demo_nice for rv64
  - Fix compile error when -Werror=shadow
  - Update helloworld and smphello due to mhartid changes

* NMSIS

  - Bump NMSIS to 1.1.1 release version, NMSIS DSP/NN prebuilt libraries are built with 1.1.1 release.

  - Add macros of HPM m/s/u event enable, events type, events idx
  - Fix define error of HPM_INIT macro
  - Due to mhartid csr update for nuclei subsystem reference design, two new API added called ``__get_hart_id`` and ``__get_cluster_id``

    - mhartid csr is now used to present cluster id and hart id for nuclei subsystem reference design
    - bit 0-7 is used for hart id in current cluster
    - bit 8-15 is used for cluster id of current cluster
    - for normal nuclei riscv cpu design, the mhartid csr is used as usual, but in NMSIS Core, we only take
      lower 8bits in use cases like systimer, startup code to support nuclei subsystem

* Build System

  - Add semihost support in build system via SEMIHOST make variable, if SEMIHOST=1, will link semihost library, currently only works with newlibc library, not working with libncrt
  - Add support for compile cpp files with suffix like .cc or .CC

  - Add extra run/restart command for openocd debug configuration in smp debug in npk for Nuclei Studio
  - Update smp/boot flow to match mhartid csr update
  - **BOOT_HARTID** is the choosen boot hart id in current cluster, not the full mhartid register value, for example, it the mhartid csr register is 0x0101, and the **BOOT_HARTID** should be set to 1, if you want hart 1 to be boot hart
  - Update and add more newlib stub functions in demosoc/evalsoc/gd32vf103 SoC's newlibc stub implementation, since we are no longer compile with ``--specs=nosys.specs``

* CI

  - Add demo_cidu and demo_cache in ci configuration files, but expect it to run fail when run in qemu

For detailed changes, please check commit histories since 0.3.2 release.

V0.3.2
------

This is release version ``0.3.2`` of Nuclei SDK.

* Build

    - **Important changes** about build system:

      - The SoC and RTOS related makefiles are moving to its own folder, and controlled By
        **build.mk** inside in in the SoC/<SOC> or OS/<RTOS> folders.
      - Middlware component build system is also available now, you can add you own middleware or library
        into ``Components`` folder, such as ``Components/tjpgd`` or ``Components/fatfs``, and you can include
        this component using make variable ``MIDDLEWARE`` in application Makefile, such as ``MIDDLEWARE := fatfs``,
        or ``MIDDLEWARE := tjpgd fatfs``.
      - Each middleware component folder should create a ``build.mk``, which is used to control
        the component build settings and source code management.
      - An extra ``DOWNLOAD_MODE_STRING`` macro is passed to represent the DOWNLOAD mode string.
      - In ``startup_<Device>.S`` now, we don't use ``DOWNLOAD_MODE`` to handle the vector table location, instead
        we defined a new macro called ``VECTOR_TABLE_REMAPPED`` to stand for whether the vector table's vma != lma.
        If ``VECTOR_TABLE_REMAPPED`` is defined, the vector table is placed in ``.vtable_ilm``, which means the vector
        table is placed in flash and copy to ilm when startup.
    - Change openocd ``--pipe`` option to ``-c "gdb_port pipe; log_output openocd.log"``
    - Remove ``-ex "monitor flash protect 0 0 last off"`` when upload or debug program to avoid error
      when openocd configuration file didn't configure a flash
    - Add ``cleanall`` target in **<NUCLEI_SDK_ROOT>/Makefile**, you can clean all the applications
      defined by ``EXTRA_APP_ROOTDIRS`` variable
    - Fix ``size`` target of build system

* Tools

    - Add ``nsdk_cli`` tools in Nuclei SDK which support run applications

      - **tools/scripts/nsdk_cli/requirements.txt**: python module requirement file
      - **tools/scripts/nsdk_cli/configs**: sample configurations used by scripts below
      - **tools/scripts/nsdk_cli/nsdk_bench.py**: nsdk bench runner script
      - **tools/scripts/nsdk_cli/nsdk_execute.py**: nsdk execute runner script

* SoC

    - Add general bit operations and memory access APIs in ``<Device>.h``, eg. ``_REG32(p, i)``, ``FLIP_BIT(regval, bitofs)``
    - ``DOWNLOAD_MODE_xxx`` macros are now placed in ``<Device>.h``, which is removed from ``riscv_encoding.h``, user can define
      different ``DOWNLOAD_MODE_xxx`` according to its device/board settings.
    - ``DOWNLOAD_MODE_STRING`` are now used to show the download mode string, which should be passed eg. ``-DOWNLOAD_MODE_STRING=\"flash\"``,
      it is used in ``system_<Device>.c``
    - ``DOWNLOAD_MODE_xxx`` now is used in ``startup_<Device>.S`` to control the vector table location,
      instead a new macro called ``VECTOR_TABLE_REMAPPED`` is used, and it should be defined in ``SoC/<SOC>/build.mk``
      if the vector table's LMA and VMA are different.

* NMSIS

    - Bump NMSIS to version 1.0.2

* OS

    - Fix OS task switch bug in RT-Thread
