V0.2.9
------

This is official version ``0.2.9`` of Nuclei SDK.

* SoC

    - Remove ``ftdi_device_desc "Dual RS232-HS"`` line in openocd configuration.

      .. note::

         Newer version of RVSTAR and Hummingbird Debugger have changed the FTDI description
         from "Dual RS232-HS" to "USB <-> JTAG-DEBUGGER", to be back-compatiable with older
         version, we just removed this ``ftdi_device_desc "Dual RS232-HS"`` line.
         If you want to select specified JTAG, you can add this ``ftdi_device_desc`` according
         to your description.

    - `_init` and `_fini` are deprecated for startup code, now please use `_premain_init` and `_postmain_fini` instead
    - Add `DDR` download mode for Hummingbird SoC, which downloaded program into DDR and execute in DDR


V0.2.4
------

This is release ``0.2.4`` of Nuclei SDK.

* Application

  - Upgrade the ``demo_dsp`` application to a more complicated one, and by default,
    ``DSP_ENABLE`` is changed from ``OFF`` to ``ON``, optimization level changed from
    ``O2`` to no optimization.

* SoC

  - Update openocd configuration file for Hummingbird FPGA evaluation board,
    If you want to use ``2-wire`` mode of JTAG, please change ``ftdi_oscan1_mode off``
    in ``openocd_hbird.cfg`` to ``ftdi_oscan1_mode on``.
  - Add ``delay_1ms`` function in all supported SoC platforms
  - Fix bugs found in uart and gpio drivers in hbird SoC
  - Move ``srodata`` after ``sdata`` for ILM linker script

  - The source code of UCOSII is fetched from https://github.com/SiliconLabs/uC-OS2/
  - **Warning**: Now for UCOSII application development, the ``app_cfg.h``, ``os_cfg.h``
    and ``app_hooks.c`` are required, which can be also found in
    https://github.com/SiliconLabs/uC-OS2/tree/master/Cfg/Template

* Application

  - Add **RT-Thread** demo application.
  - Don't use the ``get_cpu_freq`` function in application code, which currently is only
    for internal usage, and not all SoC implementations are required to provide this function.
  - Use ``SystemCoreClock`` to get the CPU frequency instead of using ``get_cpu_freq()`` in
    ``whetstone`` application.
  - Update UCOSII applications due to UCOSII version upgrade, and application development
    for UCOSII also required little changes, please refer to :ref:`design_rtos_ucosii`
