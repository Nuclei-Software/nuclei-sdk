Code Style
==========

In Nuclei N100 SDK, we use `EditorConfig`_ to maintain our development
coding styles and `astyle`_ tool to format our source code.

- Our `editorconfig file`_ is maintained in the root directory of
  Nuclei N100 SDK, called ``.editorconfig``.
- Our astyle option file is maintained in the root directory of
  Nuclei N100 SDK, called ``.astylerc``.

For example, if you want to format your applicaton code(*.c/*.h)
located in ``application/baremetal/demo_timer``, you can run the
following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    # make sure astyle is present in PATH
    which astyle
    # format code
    astyle --options=.astylerc --recursive application/baremetal/demo_timer/*.c,*.h


You can install editorconfig plugins for your editor, see https://editorconfig.org/#download.

We use `doxygen`_ to comment C/C++ source code.
